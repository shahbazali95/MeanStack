<p>The secret to being a well-oiled business machine is meshing the best available online tools, 
with solid social media strategy and a top-notch team.
Whether you have been running a small business storefront for years or you are
just starting out but have no online presence, there are many ways you can get
up to speed with how the modern online world works. Thanks to available digital 
tools and platforms as well as companies behind those solutions, you have more help
now than ever before to modernize your business without having to spend considerable 
resources to do so.

Here are 10 ways you can upgrade your business to leverage the growth opportunities available online:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Use cloud-based software programs.</h2>
<p>Having a cloud-based architecture for your business makes it much easier
and cost-effective to move your business to the online world. Doing so will 
allow you to access certain aspects of your business from anywhere and any device,
which is important in the online world where every store and website is always open.

By working behind the scenes to share information with your team and 
handle processes from anywhere, your business will appear to be working
 around the clock to serve customers.
</p>
</li>
<li><h2>Leverage solutions that personalize the online experience.</h2>
<p>Moving to the online world can be overwhelming at first because your
 audience can become so much larger yet expect you to know each one of 
them personally. Thanks to software solutions, it’s easier to accomplish 
this and actually build stronger relationships with customers that you have
 regularly serviced in-person.

For example, if you are a restaurant and want to make each customer feel as
 though you are interacting with them directly, you can leverage online tools
 that offer a database that keeps track of what those customers have ordered, 
when they have eaten at your restaurant or have a future reservation, when they
 have an upcoming special occasion and more that you can then use to personalize 
future visits, including sharing special menus that include dishes they like or 
offering a coupon for a future birthday.
